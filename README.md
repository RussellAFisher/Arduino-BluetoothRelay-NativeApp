# Ionic App to control an on-going Arduino Bluetooth Relay Device

### Native app built using Ionic and Cordova to control an Arduino triggered Relay connected via Bluetooth

This is a Ionic app created to be used with Android as a means of controlling an Arduino setup that I created as well. The logic of input is all on the Arduino side of this project.


This Android app functions as a means of interacting with the Arduino by sending predetermined characters that trigger functionality with the Arduino Relay setup.


Communication uses a BLE board connected to the Arduino and the built in BLE capabilites of the Android.
